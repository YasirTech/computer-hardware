# Computer-Hardware 

<h2> A complete guide by me on how to build a desktop computer system, including pictures of me building or upgrading my clients' orders </h2>

<h2>Computer Hardware Components Installed / Upgraded </h2>

- Desktop Case
- Motherboard
- CPU (Processor)
- CPU Cooler/Heatsink
- RAM (Random Access Memory)
- GPU (Graphics Card)
- PSU (Power Supply)
- Wireless Network Card
- Cable Management

<h2> Installation Steps </h2>
<p> Desktop Case - Before purchasing anything, you need to make sure the components you are planning to buy are compaitible and will fit inside your PC case. Motherboards come in varies sizes (micro atx, atx etc) and cases have different sizes too so you need to make sure the parts fit inside the case. </p>

<h2> Motherboard </h2> 
 <p> This is the main circuit board in the computer and one of the most important components inside the PC as it controls everyhting and without it the computer wouldnt be able to even turn on. You need to make sure any components you buy are compatible with this motherboard as each motherboard supports different CPUs and different DDR RAM sticks.</p>
 <p> *Note* be very careful when handling the motherboard as its very fragile you need to handle it with delicacy and make sure you are using an anti-static wrist wrap or grounded and use the anti static bag it came with to put it on so it won't get static damage. </p>

<h2> RAM (Random Access Memory) </h2>
This is a type of computer memory that is used to store fata and programs that are currently been used by your computer. This memory comes in various sizes and speeds so its important to make sure its compatible with your motherboard before purchasing. The more RAM memory you have, the most applications you can have running in the background without the computer starting to slow down, also newer games these days require atleast 16gb of ram, as the higher graphic settings use a lot of memory. </p>
<p> Very easy to install it slots into the PCI slots onto the motherboard just need to line it up correctly and slot it in the PCI slot and it clicks in.  </p>

<h2> CPU / CPU Cooler </h2>
<p> The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of the computer. It processes all the instructions and data needed to run programs, apps, and essentially everything your computer does. When building a PC, the CPU should be a primary consideration since it’s one of the most critical components.  </p>
<p> Back in 2010, CPUs typically had 2 cores and 2 threads, or 4 cores and 4 threads. Today, technology has advanced significantly, with CPUs offering up to 12 cores and 24 threads (mine has 8 cores and 16 threads). This leap in speed and performance continues to amaze me. To keep the CPU functioning efficiently, a CPU cooler or heatsink is essential. As the name suggests, it keeps the processor cool and prevents overheating. </p>
<p> The CPU is installed by placing it into the processor slot on the motherboard. Make sure it's aligned correctly—both the CPU and the motherboard have a small gold triangle that needs to be matched up. Once aligned, carefully place the CPU into the slot and press down on the lever to secure it. </p>
<p> Before attaching the CPU, cooler or heatsink, make sure to apply thermal paste on top of the CPU. This helps with heat transfer and ensures the processor stays cool and doesn’t overheat when in use. </p>

<h2> Power Supply </h2>
<p> The PSU (Power Supply Unit) provides electrical power to the entire system, powering up all the components. When purchasing a PSU, it’s important to make sure it has enough wattage to support your system. Power supplies come in various capacities like 500W, 650W, 800W, etc. The power requirements of your components will determine the size of the PSU you need. </p>
<p> To install the PSU, place it in the designated power supply compartment in your PC case, then secure it by screwing in the 4 screws to hold it in place. </p>

<h2> *Quick tip*: </h2>
<p> Before placing anything inside the case, it’s a good idea to test the components to ensure everything is working properly, which saves the hassle of reassembling later. </p>
<p> To do this, connect the power supply plug to a wall, then attach the 24-pin connector to the motherboard and the 6/8-pin CPU connector to the motherboard. The CPU and RAM are already slotted in the motherboard, you can also slot in the graphics card if you are planning to add one into this system. To power on the system, gently touch the two power switch header pins on the motherboard with a metal screwdriver. </p>
<p> If everything is working properly, the system will power on and the CPU cooler fan will spin. Let it run for about 5 minutes to make sure there are no overheating issues from improper cooler installation. If you reach this point, congratulations—your main components are functioning properly! </p>

<h2> Placing motherboard in case </h2>
<p> Before placing the motherboard in the case, please make sure case standoff screws are placed the correct position. The screws should align with the mounting holes on your motherboard and this provides proper support </p>
<p>  If your motherboard doesn't have a built-in I/O shield, you'll need to attach the I/O shield to the case. This can be a bit fidgety/tricky—just make sure it clicks into place on both sides from inside the case and that’s done.  </p>
<p> Once the motherboard is placed in, gently screw down each hole through the mounting holes in the case until all are done. </p>

<h2> Case Wires & Cable Management </h2>
<p> For clean cable management, I recommend to run the case cables along the backside of the case. Next, connect the case's front panel connectors (Power SW, HDD LED, Power LED +/-, and Reset SW) to the correct pins on the motherboard. These connections are usually located on the bottom-right side of the motherboard, but the exact positioning and pin layout can vary depending on your model, please check your motherboard manual for the correct way for the motherboard you are using. </p>

<h2> Cable Management, Attach Cables to Motherboard </h2>
<p> Once the power supply is secured with screws, ensure good cable management by again, running the case wires along the back side of the case. Keep the cables bundled together to prevent clutter and I highly recommend using cable ties as this will make it so much easier for clean cable management. </p>
<p> Plug in the 24-pin motherboard connector and the 6- or 8-pin CPU connector into their respective ports on the motherboard. Save the PCIe cables for now, as you’ll need them later for connecting drives and the graphics card. </p>

<h2> M.2 / HDD / SSD drives </h2>
Place any drives into the drive bays in the case and secure them with screws. Connect the SATA cables from the SSD/HDD to the SATA ports on the motherboard, and plug the power cables from the power supply into the drives. </p>
<p> If you have a modern M.2 SSD, installation is even simpler. Just insert the SSD into the M.2 slot on the motherboard and secure it with a single screw. </p>

<h2> Graphics Card / Wireless Network Card </h2>
If you have a graphics card or a wireless network card, these are the final component to install. Plug the graphics card into the PCIe x16 slot on the motherboard, if you are wanting to install a wireless network card that goes into the PCI slot just underneath the graphics card slot. Remove the appropriate PCIe slot covers from the case, then insert the GPU, wireless network card until you hear it click into place. Secure the card by screwing it down on the left side where you removed the PCIe covers. Finally, connect the PCIe power supply cables to the graphics card. </p>

<h2> Last Steps </h2>
<p> Screw in the side panel of the case and that’s all done, power on the system :) </p>
<p> Once you have slotted the side panel, turn on the system and if everything is going fine it will go into BIOS and all of the fans/case fans and lights inside of the desktop will be spinning/on and you are ready to install your operating system! </p>
